The disagreement stems over a deceptively simple question: What is the easiest way for people to shop for a health plan? On the surface, it seems straightforward: Consumers should be able to easily compare different insurance plans and choose one that best fits them, like buying a car. In practice, it’s an extremely thorny problem. Insurance plans are far too complicated to make apples-to-apples comparisons: they have varying premiums, co-pays and deductibles. They have different networks and cover different medical services and products. Navigating all of those options can frustrate even experts. For everyday Americans, it can seem impossible. The Obama administration tried to solve this problem in a few ways. For one, if consumers wanted to receive subsidies (and many are eligible), they’d need to shop on online health insurance exchanges, run by states or the federal government. (Consumers could also qualify for subsidies if they chose a plan through select online brokers, approved and tightly regulated by the government.) This allowed the government to design a public platform for consumers to compare plans; the Obama White House referred to the exchanges as the “Expedia” for health insurance.
